# Context Relationships Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. Database Schema
Added `context_relationships` table to store relationships between context items:
- `id`: Primary key
- `session_id`: Session ID
- `from_key`: Source context item key
- `to_key`: Target context item key
- `relationship_type`: Type of relationship
- `metadata`: Optional JSON metadata
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- Unique constraint on (session_id, from_key, to_key, relationship_type)
- Indexes on from_key, to_key, and relationship_type for performance

### 2. Repository Methods
Added the following methods to `ContextRepository`:

- `createRelationship()`: Create a new relationship between two context items
  - Validates relationship types
  - Checks that both items exist
  - Prevents duplicate relationships
  - Supports optional metadata

- `getRelatedItems()`: Get items related to a given context item
  - Supports filtering by relationship type
  - Supports depth traversal (multi-level relationships)
  - Supports direction filtering (outgoing/incoming/both)
  - Includes cycle detection during traversal
  - Returns graph visualization data for depth > 1

- `deleteRelationship()`: Delete a specific relationship
- `deleteAllRelationshipsForItem()`: Delete all relationships for an item
- `getRelationshipStats()`: Get statistics about relationships
- `findCycles()`: Find circular dependencies in the relationship graph

### 3. Tool Handlers
Added two new tools in `index.ts`:

#### `context_link`
- Creates relationships between context items
- Parameters: sourceKey, targetKey, relationship, metadata (optional)
- Validates inputs and returns detailed error messages
- Returns the created relationship ID

#### `context_get_related`
- Gets items related to a given context item
- Parameters: key, relationship (optional), depth (default: 1), direction (default: 'both')
- Returns related items with relationship details
- For depth > 1, includes graph visualization data

### 4. Tool Schemas
Added proper tool definitions to ListToolsRequestSchema with:
- Comprehensive descriptions
- Parameter types and validation
- Enum values for relationship types and directions

### 5. Test Fix
Fixed the failing cycle detection test by correcting the test setup to actually create a cycle (project.api -> project.database -> project.api)

## Supported Relationship Types:
- contains
- depends_on
- references
- implements
- extends
- related_to
- blocks
- blocked_by
- parent_of
- child_of
- has_task
- documented_in
- serves
- leads_to

## Key Features:
- Bidirectional relationship support
- Cycle detection
- Multi-level traversal with depth control
- Metadata support for relationships
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimized with proper indexes
- Atomic operations with transaction support
