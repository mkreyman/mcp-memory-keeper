## 🔴 NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Enhanced context_timeline** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
Current implementation has basic parameters but is MISSING key enhancements:

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ `sessionId`
- ✅ `startDate`/`endDate`
- ✅ `groupBy`
- ✅ `categories` - Filter by categories
- ✅ `relativeTime` - Natural language time support
- ✅ `itemsPerPeriod` - Max items per period
- ✅ `includeItems` - Include item details

**Still Missing:**
- ❌ `minItemsPerPeriod` - Only show periods with N+ items
- ❌ `showEmpty` - Include periods with 0 items (default: false)

**Known Issues:**
- The enhancement doc mentions timeline returns empty results even when items exist
- Need to verify if this bug has been fixed

### 2. **Batch Operations** 🔴 MEDIUM PRIORITY - NOT IMPLEMENTED
None of the batch operations have been implemented:
- ❌ `context_batch_save` - Save multiple items at once
- ❌ `context_batch_delete` - Delete multiple items
- ❌ `context_batch_update` - Update multiple items

**Impact:** Users must loop to perform multiple operations, which is inefficient

### 3. **Context Relationships** 🔴 MEDIUM PRIORITY - NOT IMPLEMENTED
Relationship management not implemented:
- ❌ `context_link` - Create relationships between items
- ❌ `context_get_related` - Get related items

**Note:** Some relationship functionality exists in knowledge graph features but not as dedicated tools

### 4. **Advanced Search Features** 🔴 LOW PRIORITY - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
While basic search is enhanced, advanced features are missing:
- ❌ `fuzzyMatching` - Fuzzy text matching
- ❌ `semanticSearch` - Semantic/AI-powered search
- ❌ `boostRecent` - Boost recent items in relevance scoring

**Note:** `context_semantic_search` exists but is separate from main search tool

### 5. **Context Analytics** 🔴 LOW PRIORITY - NOT IMPLEMENTED
No dedicated analytics tool:
- ❌ `context_analytics` - Usage patterns, category distribution, growth rate
- ❌ Metrics aggregation
- ❌ Trend analysis

**Note:** Some stats available via `context_channel_stats` but not comprehensive analytics

## 📊 Implementation Summary

### By Priority Level:

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- ✅ Enhanced context_get - **DONE**
- ⚠️ Enhanced context_timeline - **PARTIALLY DONE** (missing 2 parameters)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- ✅ Communication Channels - **DONE**
- ✅ Enhanced context_search - **DONE**
- ✅ context_diff tool - **DONE**
- ✅ Enhanced context_export - **DONE**
- ❌ Batch Operations - **NOT DONE**
- ❌ Context Relationships - **NOT DONE**

**LOW PRIORITY:**
- ✅ Channel management tools - **DONE**
- ✅ context_watch tool - **DONE**
- ❌ Advanced Search Features - **PARTIALLY DONE**
- ❌ Context Analytics - **NOT DONE**

## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Order

Based on user impact and the enhancement document's emphasis:

### 1. **Complete context_timeline Enhancement** (1-2 hours)
- Add `minItemsPerPeriod` parameter
- Add `showEmpty` parameter
- Fix any bugs causing empty results
- This was marked HIGH PRIORITY in the original document

### 2. **Implement Batch Operations** (2-3 hours)
- `context_batch_save` - Most useful for bulk imports
- `context_batch_delete` - Useful for cleanup
- `context_batch_update` - Less critical but completes the set

### 3. **Add Context Relationships** (3-4 hours)
- `context_link` - Create typed relationships
- `context_get_related` - Navigate relationships
- Could integrate with existing knowledge graph features

### 4. **Enhance Search with Advanced Features** (2-3 hours)
- Add fuzzy matching to existing search
- Add boost recent option
- Consider merging semantic_search into main search

### 5. **Create Analytics Tool** (4-5 hours)
- Comprehensive usage analytics
- Trend analysis
- Category/channel insights

## 🔍 Additional Findings

### Existing Features Not in Enhancement Doc:
The current implementation includes several features not mentioned in the enhancement document:
- Knowledge graph functionality (analyze, find_related, visualize)
- Session branching and merging
- Journal entries
- Compression features
- Git integration
- File caching and change detection
- Semantic search (as separate tool)
- Agent delegation
- Import/export enhancements

### Schema Update Reminder:
The enhancement document emphasizes updating tool schemas when adding features. Need to verify all implemented features have proper schema definitions in the ListToolsRequestSchema handler.

## 💡 Conclusion

The implementation is approximately **85% complete** relative to the enhancement document:

**Major Wins:**
- All critical retrieval enhancements (context_get) are done
- Channel system fully implemented
- Most search enhancements complete
- Diff functionality working

**Key Gaps:**
- context_timeline needs 2 more parameters
- Batch operations would significantly improve efficiency
- Relationship management would enhance multi-agent coordination
- Analytics would provide valuable insights

The highest impact remaining work is completing the context_timeline enhancements and implementing batch operations.
